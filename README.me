# The Chuck Norris Chatbot

Diary of working process.
1. Looked at a couple of chatbot tutorials. The basic architecture includes:
- NodeJS at the core, connected with all others
- FB Send API
- Data
- Dababase
- Deployment platform
- NLP (I'll put that aside, since we hopefully need much simpler interactions)
2. Added FB webhooks
3. Deploying the app to Heroku
4. Adding Dababase
